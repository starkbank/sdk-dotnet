# Stark Bank .NET SDK Beta

Welcome to the Stark Bank .NET SDK! This tool is made for .NET
developers who want to easily integrate with our API.
This SDK version is compatible with the Stark Bank API v2.

If you have no idea what Stark Bank is, check out our [website](https://www.starkbank.com/)
and discover a world where receiving or making payments
is as easy as sending a text message to your client!

## Supported .NET Versions

This library supports the following .NET versions:

* .NET Standard 2.1+

## Stark Bank API documentation

Feel free to take a look at our [API docs](https://www.starkbank.com/docs/api).

## Versioning

This project adheres to the following versioning pattern:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment:

- MAJOR version when the **API** version is incremented. This may include backwards incompatible changes;
- MINOR version when **breaking changes** are introduced OR **new functionalities** are added in a backwards compatible manner;
- PATCH version when backwards compatible bug **fixes** are implemented.

## Setup

### 1. Install our SDK

StarkBank`s .NET SDK is available on NuGet as starkbank 0.1.0.

1.1 To install the Package Manager:

```sh
Install-Package starkbank -Version 0.1.0
```

1.2 To install the .NET CLI:

```sh
dotnet add package starkbank --version 0.1.0
```

1.3 To install by PackageReference:

```sh
<PackageReference Include="starkbank" Version="0.1.0" />
```

1.4 To install with Paket CLI:

```sh
paket add starkbank --version 0.1.0
```

### 2. Create your Private and Public Keys

We use ECDSA. That means you need to generate a secp256k1 private
key to sign your requests to our API, and register your public key
with us so we can validate those requests.

You can use one of following methods:

2.1. Check out the options in our [tutorial](https://starkbank.com/faq/how-to-create-ecdsa-keys).

2.2. Use our SDK:

```c#
(string privateKey, string publicKey) = StarkBank.Key.Create();

# or, to also save .pem files in a specific path
(string privateKey, string publicKey) = StarkBank.Key.Create("file/keys");
```

**NOTE**: When you are creating a new Project, it is recommended that you create the
keys inside the infrastructure that will use it, in order to avoid risky internet
transmissions of your **private-key**. Then you can export the **public-key** alone to the
computer where it will be used in the new Project creation.

### 3. Create a Project

You need a project for direct API integrations. To create one in Sandbox:

3.1. Log into [Starkbank Sandbox](https://sandbox.web.starkbank.com)

3.2. Go to Menu > Usuários (Users) > Projetos (Projects)

3.3. Create a Project: Give it a name and upload the public key you created in section 2.

3.4. After creating the Project, get its Project ID

3.5. Use the Project ID and private key to create the object below:

```c#
// Get your private key from an environment variable or an encrypted database.
// This is only an example of a private key content. You should use your own key.
string privateKeyContent = "-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----\nBgUrgQQACg==\n-----END EC PARAMETERS-----\n-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nMHQCAQEEIMCwW74H6egQkTiz87WDvLNm7fK/cA+ctA2vg/bbHx3woAcGBSuBBAAK\noUQDQgAE0iaeEHEgr3oTbCfh8U2L+r7zoaeOX964xaAnND5jATGpD/tHec6Oe9U1\nIF16ZoTVt1FzZ8WkYQ3XomRD4HS13A==\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----";

StarkBank.Project project = new StarkBank.Project(
    environment: "sandbox",
    id: "5656565656565656",
    privateKey: privateKeyContent
);
```

NOTE 1: Never hard-code your private key. Get it from an environment variable or an encrypted database.

NOTE 2: We support `'sandbox'` and `'production'` as environments.

NOTE 3: The project you created in `sandbox` does not exist in `production` and vice versa.


### 4. Setting up the user

There are two kinds of users that can access our API: **Project** and **Member**.

- `Member` is the one you use when you log into our webpage with your e-mail.
- `Project` is designed for integrations and is the one meant for our SDK.

There are two ways to inform the user to the SDK:

4.1 Passing the user as argument in all functions:

```c#
StarkBank.Balance balance = StarkBank.Balance.Get(user: project);
```

4.2 Set it as a default user in the SDK:

```c#
StarkBank.User.Default = project;

StarkBank.Balance balance = StarkBank.Balance.Get();
```

Just select the way of passing the project user that is more convenient to you.
On all following examples we will assume a default user has been set.

## Testing in Sandbox

Your initial balance is zero. For many operations in Stark Bank, you"ll need funds
in your account, which can be added to your balance by creating a Boleto.

In the Sandbox environment, 90% of the created Boletos will be automatically paid,
so there"s nothing else you need to do to add funds to your account. Just create
a few and wait around a bit.

In Production, you (or one of your clients) will need to actually pay this Boleto
for the value to be credited to your account.

## Usage

Here are a few examples on how to use the SDK. If you have any doubts, check out
the function or class docstring to get more info or go straight to our [API docs].

### Get balance

To know how much money you have in your workspace, run:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Balance balance = StarkBank.Balance.Get();

Console.WriteLine(balance);
```

### Create boletos

You can create boletos to charge customers or to receive money from accounts
you have in other banks.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.Boleto> boletos = StarkBank.Boleto.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.Boleto> {
        new StarkBank.Boleto(
            amount: 23571,  // R$ 235,71
            name: "Buzz Aldrin",
            taxID: "012.345.678-90",
            streetLine1: "Av. Paulista, 200",
            streetLine2: "10 andar",
            district: "Bela Vista",
            city: "São Paulo",
            stateCode: "SP",
            zipCode: "01310-000",
            due: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(30),
            fine: 5,  // 5%
            interest: 2.5  // 2.5% per month
        )
    }
);

foreach (StarkBank.Boleto boleto in boletos) {
    Console.WriteLine(boleto);
}
```

### Get boleto

After its creation, information on a boleto may be retrieved by passing its id.
Its status indicates whether it's been paid.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Boleto boleto = StarkBank.Boleto.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(boleto);
```

### Get boleto PDF

After its creation, a boleto PDF may be retrieved by passing its id.

```c#
byte[] pdf = StarkBank.Boleto.Pdf("5155165527080960");

System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes("boleto.pdf", pdf);
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Delete boleto

You can also cancel a boleto by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been processed already.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Boleto boleto = StarkBank.Boleto.Delete("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(boleto);
```

### Query boletos

You can get a list of created boletos given some filters.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Boleto> boletos = StarkBank.Boleto.Query(
    after: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-10),
    before: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-1)
);

foreach(StarkBank.Boleto boleto in boletos) {
    Console.WriteLine(boleto);
}
```

### Query boleto logs

Logs are pretty important to understand the life cycle of a boleto.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Boleto.Log> logs = StarkBank.Boleto.Log.Query(limit: 150);

foreach(StarkBank.Boleto.Log log in logs) {
    Console.WriteLine(log);
}
```

### Get a boleto log

You can get a single log by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Boleto.Log log = StarkBank.Boleto.Log.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(log);
```

### Create transfers

You can also create transfers in the SDK (TED/DOC).

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.Transfer> transfers = StarkBank.Transfer.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.Transfer> {
        new StarkBank.Transfer(
            amount: 100,  // R$ 1,00
            bankCode: "033",
            branchCode: "0001",
            accountNumber: "10000-0",
            taxID: "012.345.678-90",
            name: "Tony Stark",
            tags: new List<string> { "iron", "suit" }
        ),
        new StarkBank.Transfer(
            amount: 200,  // R$ 2,00
            bankCode: "341",
            branchCode: "1234",
            accountNumber: "123456-7",
            taxID: "012.345.678-90",
            name: "Jon Snow"
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.Transfer transfer in transfers) {
    Console.WriteLine(transfer);
}
```

### Query transfers

You can query multiple transfers according to filters.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Transfer> transfers = StarkBank.Transfer.Query(
    after: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-10),
    before: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-1)
);

foreach(StarkBank.Transfer transfer in transfers) {
    Console.WriteLine(transfer.Name);
}
```

### Get transfer

To get a single transfer by its id, run:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Transfer transfer = StarkBank.Transfer.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(transfer);
```

### Get transfer PDF

A transfer PDF may also be retrieved by passing its id.
This operation is only valid if the transfer status is "processing" or "success".

```c#
byte[] pdf = StarkBank.Transfer.Pdf("5155165527080960");

System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes("transfer.pdf", pdf);
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Query transfer logs

You can query transfer logs to better understand transfer life cycles.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Transfer.Log> logs = StarkBank.Transfer.Log.Query(limit: 50);

foreach(StarkBank.Transfer.Log log in logs) {
    Console.WriteLine(log);
}
```

### Get a transfer log

You can also get a specific log by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Transfer.Log log = StarkBank.Transfer.Log.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(log);
```

### Pay a boleto

Paying a boleto is also simple.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.BoletoPayment> payments = StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.BoletoPayment> {
        new StarkBank.BoletoPayment(
            line: "34191.09008 64694.017308 71444.640008 1 96610000014500",
            taxID: "012.345.678-90",
            scheduled: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(2),
            description: "take my money",
            tags: new List<string> { "take", "my", "money" }
        ),
        new StarkBank.BoletoPayment(
            barCode: "34191972300000289001090064694197307144464000",
            taxID: "012.345.678-90",
            scheduled: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(1),
            description: "take my money one more time",
            tags: new List<string> { "again" }
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BoletoPayment payment in payments) {
    Console.WriteLine(payment);
}
```

### Get boleto payment

To get a single boleto payment by its id, run:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.BoletoPayment payment = StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Get("19278361897236187236");

Console.WriteLine(payment);
```

### Get boleto payment PDF

After its creation, a boleto payment PDF may be retrieved by passing its id.

```c#
byte[] pdf = StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Pdf("5155165527080960");

System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes("boleto_payment.pdf", pdf);
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Delete boleto payment

You can also cancel a boleto payment by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been processed already.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.BoletoPayment payment = StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Delete("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(payment);
```

### Query boleto payments

You can search for boleto payments using filters.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.BoletoPayment> payments = StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Query(
    tags: new List<string> { "company_1", "company_2" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BoletoPayment payment in payments) {
    Console.WriteLine(payment);
}
```

### Query boleto payment logs

Searches are also possible with boleto payment logs:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Log> logs = StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Log.Query(
    paymentIds: new List<string> { "5155165527080960", "76551659167801921" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Log log in logs) {
    Console.WriteLine(log);
}
```


### Get boleto payment log

You can also get a boleto payment log by specifying its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Log log = StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Log.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(log);
```

### Create utility payment

It"s also simple to pay utility bills (such as electricity and water bills) in the SDK.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.UtilityPayment> payments = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.UtilityPayment> {
        new StarkBank.UtilityPayment(
            line: "83680000001 7 08660138003 0 71070987611 8 00041351685 7",
            scheduled: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(2),
            description: "take my money",
            tags: new List<string> { "take", "my", "money" }
        ),
        new StarkBank.UtilityPayment(
            barCode: "83600000001512801380037107172881100021296561",
            scheduled: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(1),
            description: "take my money one more time",
            tags: new List<string> { "again" }
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.UtilityPayment payment in payments) {
    Console.WriteLine(payment);
}
```

### Query utility payments

To search for utility payments using filters, run:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.UtilityPayment> payments = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Query(
    tags: new List<string> { "electricity", "gas" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.UtilityPayment payment in payments) {
    Console.WriteLine(payment);
}
```

### Get utility payment

You can get a specific bill by its id:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.UtilityPayment payment = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(payment);
```

### Get utility payment PDF

After its creation, a utility payment PDF may also be retrieved by passing its id.

```c#
byte[] pdf = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Pdf("5155165527080960");

System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes("electricity_payment.pdf", pdf);
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Delete utility payment

You can also cancel a utility payment by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been processed already.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.UtilityPayment payment = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Delete("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(payment);
```

### Query utility bill payment logs

You can search for payments by specifying filters. Use this to understand the
bills life cycles.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log> logs = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log.Query(
    paymentIds: new List<string> { "102893710982379182", "92837912873981273" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log log in logs) {
    Console.WriteLine(log);
}
```

### Get utility bill payment log

If you want to get a specific payment log by its id, just run:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log log = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log.Get("1902837198237992");

Console.WriteLine(log);
```

### Create transactions

To send money between Stark Bank accounts, you can create transactions:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.Transaction> transactions = StarkBank.Transaction.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.Transaction> {
        new StarkBank.Transaction(
            amount: 100,  // (R$ 1.00)
            receiverID: "1029378109327810",
            description: "Transaction to dear provider",
            externalID: "12345",  // so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
            tags: new List<string> { "provider" }
        ),
        new StarkBank.Transaction(
            amount: 234,  // (R$ 2.34)
            receiverID: "2093029347820947",
            description: "Transaction to the other provider",
            externalID: "12346",  // so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
            tags: new List<string> { "provider" }
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.Transaction transaction in transactions) {
    Console.WriteLine(transaction);
}
```

### Query transactions

To understand your balance changes (bank statement), you can query
transactions. Note that our system creates transactions for you when
you receive boleto payments, pay a bill or make transfers, for example.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Transaction> transactions = StarkBank.Transaction.Query(
    after: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-10),
    before: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-1)
);

foreach(StarkBank.Transaction transaction in transactions) {
    Console.WriteLine(transaction);
}
```

### Get transaction

You can get a specific transaction by its id:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Transaction transaction = StarkBank.Transaction.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(transaction);
```

### Create webhook subscription

To create a webhook subscription and be notified whenever an event occurs, run:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Webhook webhook = StarkBank.Webhook.Create(
    url: "https://webhook.site/dd784f26-1d6a-4ca6-81cb-fda0267761ec",
    subscriptions: new List<string> { "transfer", "boleto", "boleto-payment", "utility-payment" }
);

Console.WriteLine(webhook);
```

### Query webhooks

To search for registered webhooks, run:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Webhook> webhooks = StarkBank.Webhook.Query();

foreach(StarkBank.Webhook webhook in webhooks) {
    Console.WriteLine(webhook);
}
```

### Get webhook

You can get a specific webhook by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Webhook webhook = StarkBank.Webhook.Get("10827361982368179");

Console.WriteLine(webhook);
```

### Delete webhook

You can also delete a specific webhook by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Webhook webhook = StarkBank.Webhook.Delete("10827361982368179");

Console.WriteLine(webhook);
```

### Process webhook events

It"s easy to process events that arrived in your webhook. Remember to pass the
signature header so the SDK can make sure it's really StarkBank that sent you
the event.

```c#
using System;

Response response = listen();  // this is the method you made to get the events posted to your webhook

StarkBank.Event parsedEvent = StarkBank.Event.Parse(
    content: response.Content,
    signature: response.Headers["Digital-Signature"]
);

if (parsedEvent.Subscription == "transfer") {
    StarkBank.Transfer.Log log = parsedEvent.Log as StarkBank.Transfer.Log;
    Console.WriteLine(log.Transfer);
}
else if (parsedEvent.Subscription == "boleto") {
    StarkBank.Boleto.Log log = parsedEvent.Log as StarkBank.Boleto.Log;
    Console.WriteLine(log.Boleto);
}
else if (parsedEvent.Subscription == "boleto-payment") {
    StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Log log = parsedEvent.Log as StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Log;
    Console.WriteLine(log.Payment);
}
else if (parsedEvent.Subscription == "utility-payment") {
    StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log log = parsedEvent.Log as StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log;
    Console.WriteLine(log.Payment);
}
```

### Query webhook events

To search for webhook events, run:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Event> events = StarkBank.Event.Query(
    after: DateTime.Today,
    isDelivered: false
);

foreach(StarkBank.Event eventObject in events) {
    Console.WriteLine(eventObject);
}
```

### Get webhook event

You can get a specific webhook event by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Event eventObject = StarkBank.Event.Get("10827361982368179");

Console.WriteLine(eventObject);
```

### Delete webhook event

You can also delete a specific webhook event by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Event eventObject = StarkBank.Event.Delete("10827361982368179");

Console.WriteLine(eventObject);
```

### Set webhook events as delivered

This can be used in case you"ve lost events.
With this function, you can manually set events retrieved from the API as
"delivered" to help future event queries with `isDelivered: false`.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Event eventObject = StarkBank.Event.Update("129837198237192", isDelivered: true);

Console.WriteLine(eventObject);
```

## Handling errors

The SDK may raise one of four types of errors: __InputErrors__, __InternalServerError__, __UnknownError__, __InvalidSignatureError__

__InputErrors__ will be raised whenever the API detects an error in your request (status code 400).
If you catch such an error, you can get its elements to verify each of the
individual errors that were detected in your request by the API.
For example:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using StarkBank.Error;

try {
    List<StarkBank.Transaction> transactions = StarkBank.Transaction.Create(
        new List<StarkBank.Transaction> {
            new StarkBank.Transaction(
                amount: 99999999999999,  // (R$ 999,999,999,999.99)
                receiverID: "1029378109327810",
                description: ".",
                externalID: "12345",  // so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
                tags: new List<string> { "provider" }
            )
        }
    );
} catch (InputErrors e) {
    foreach (ErrorElement error in e.Errors) {
        Console.WriteLine(error.Code);
        Console.WriteLine(error.Message);
    }

__InternalServerError__ will be raised if the API runs into an internal error.
If you ever stumble upon this one, rest assured that the development team
is already rushing in to fix the mistake and get you back up to speed.

__UnknownError__ will be raised if a request encounters an error that is
neither __InputErrors__ nor an __InternalServerError__, such as connectivity problems.

__InvalidSignatureError__ will be raised specifically by StarkBank.Event.parse()
when the provided content and signature do not check out with the Stark Bank public
key.
