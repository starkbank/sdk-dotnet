# Stark Bank .NET SDK

Welcome to the Stark Bank .NET SDK! This tool is made for .NET
developers who want to easily integrate with our API.
This SDK version is compatible with the Stark Bank API v2.

If you have no idea what Stark Bank is, check out our [website](https://www.starkbank.com/)
and discover a world where receiving or making payments
is as easy as sending a text message to your client!

## Supported .NET Versions

This library supports the following .NET versions:

* .NET Standard 2.0+

## Stark Bank API documentation

Feel free to take a look at our [API docs](https://www.starkbank.com/docs/api).

## Versioning

This project adheres to the following versioning pattern:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment:

- MAJOR version when the **API** version is incremented. This may include backwards incompatible changes;
- MINOR version when **breaking changes** are introduced OR **new functionalities** are added in a backwards compatible manner;
- PATCH version when backwards compatible bug **fixes** are implemented.

## Setup

### 1. Install our SDK

StarkBank`s .NET SDK is available on NuGet as starkbank 2.2.0.

1.1 To install the Package Manager:

```sh
Install-Package starkbank -Version 2.2.0
```

1.2 To install the .NET CLI:

```sh
dotnet add package starkbank --version 2.2.0
```

1.3 To install by PackageReference:

```sh
<PackageReference Include="starkbank" Version="2.2.0" />
```

1.4 To install with Paket CLI:

```sh
paket add starkbank --version 2.2.0
```

### 2. Create your Private and Public Keys

We use ECDSA. That means you need to generate a secp256k1 private
key to sign your requests to our API, and register your public key
with us so we can validate those requests.

You can use one of following methods:

2.1. Check out the options in our [tutorial](https://starkbank.com/faq/how-to-create-ecdsa-keys).

2.2. Use our SDK:

```c#
(string privateKey, string publicKey) = StarkBank.Key.Create();

# or, to also save .pem files in a specific path
(string privateKey, string publicKey) = StarkBank.Key.Create("file/keys");
```

**NOTE**: When you are creating a new Project, it is recommended that you create the
keys inside the infrastructure that will use it, in order to avoid risky internet
transmissions of your **private-key**. Then you can export the **public-key** alone to the
computer where it will be used in the new Project creation.

### 3. Create a Project

You need a project for direct API integrations. To create one in Sandbox:

3.1. Log into [Starkbank Sandbox](https://sandbox.web.starkbank.com)

3.2. Go to Menu > UsuÃ¡rios (Users) > Projetos (Projects)

3.3. Create a Project: Give it a name and upload the public key you created in section 2.

3.4. After creating the Project, get its Project ID

3.5. Use the Project ID and private key to create the object below:

```c#
// Get your private key from an environment variable or an encrypted database.
// This is only an example of a private key content. You should use your own key.
string privateKeyContent = "-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----\nBgUrgQQACg==\n-----END EC PARAMETERS-----\n-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nMHQCAQEEIMCwW74H6egQkTiz87WDvLNm7fK/cA+ctA2vg/bbHx3woAcGBSuBBAAK\noUQDQgAE0iaeEHEgr3oTbCfh8U2L+r7zoaeOX964xaAnND5jATGpD/tHec6Oe9U1\nIF16ZoTVt1FzZ8WkYQ3XomRD4HS13A==\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----";

StarkBank.Project project = new StarkBank.Project(
    environment: "sandbox",
    id: "5656565656565656",
    privateKey: privateKeyContent
);
```

NOTE 1: Never hard-code your private key. Get it from an environment variable or an encrypted database.

NOTE 2: We support `'sandbox'` and `'production'` as environments.

NOTE 3: The project you created in `sandbox` does not exist in `production` and vice versa.


### 4. Setting up the user

There are two kinds of users that can access our API: **Project** and **Member**.

- `Member` is the one you use when you log into our webpage with your e-mail.
- `Project` is designed for integrations and is the one meant for our SDK.

There are two ways to inform the user to the SDK:

4.1 Passing the user as argument in all functions:

```c#
StarkBank.Balance balance = StarkBank.Balance.Get(user: project);
```

4.2 Set it as a default user in the SDK:

```c#
StarkBank.Settings.User = project;

StarkBank.Balance balance = StarkBank.Balance.Get();
```

Just select the way of passing the project user that is more convenient to you.
On all following examples we will assume a default user has been set.

### 5. Setting up the error language

The error language can also be set in the same way as the default user:

```c#
StarkBank.Settings.Language = "en-US";
```

Language options are "en-US" for english and "pt-BR" for brazilian portuguese. English is default.

## Testing in Sandbox

Your initial balance is zero. For many operations in Stark Bank, you"ll need funds
in your account, which can be added to your balance by creating a Boleto.

In the Sandbox environment, 90% of the created Boletos will be automatically paid,
so there"s nothing else you need to do to add funds to your account. Just create
a few and wait around a bit.

In Production, you (or one of your clients) will need to actually pay this Boleto
for the value to be credited to your account.

## Usage

Here are a few examples on how to use the SDK. If you have any doubts, check out
the function or class docstring to get more info or go straight to our [API docs].

### Get balance

To know how much money you have in your workspace, run:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Balance balance = StarkBank.Balance.Get();

Console.WriteLine(balance);
```

### Get dict key

You can get PIX key's parameters by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.DictKey dictKey = DictKey.Get("tony@starkbank.com");

Console.WriteLine(dictKey);
```

### Query your DICT keys

To take a look at the PIX keys linked to your workspace, just run the following:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.DictKey> dictKeys = StarkBank.DictKey.Query(
    status: "registered",
    type: "evp"
);

foreach(StarkBank.DictKey dictKey in dictKeys) {
    Console.WriteLine(dictKey);
}
```

### Create invoices

You can create dynamic QR Code invoices to charge customers or to receive money from accounts
you have in other banks.

```c#
# coding: utf-8
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.Invoice> invoices = StarkBank.Invoice.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.Invoice> {
        new StarkBank.Invoice(
            amount: 248,
            descriptions: new List<Dictionary<string, object>>() {
                new Dictionary<string, object> {
                    {"key", "Arya"},
                    {"value", "Not today"}
                }
            },
            discounts: new List<Dictionary<string, object>>() {
                new Dictionary<string, object> {
                    {"percentage", 10},
                    {"due", new DateTime(2021, 4, 25, 13, 17, 15)}
                }
            },
            due: new DateTime(2021, 5, 25, 13, 17, 15),
            expiration: 123456789,
            fine: 2.5,
            interest: 1.3,
            name: "Arya Stark",
            tags: new List<string> { "New sword", "Invoice #1234" },
            taxID: "29.176.331/0001-69"
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.Invoice invoice in invoices) {
    Console.WriteLine(invoice);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using Invoice objects, you can also pass each invoice element in dictionary format

### Get an invoice

After its creation, information on an invoice may be retrieved by its id.
Its status indicates whether it's been paid.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Invoice invoice = StarkBank.Invoice.Get("5715709195714560");

Console.WriteLine(invoice);
```

### Get an invoice QRCode

After its creation, an invoice QRCode may be retrieved by its id.

```c#
using System;

byte[] png = StarkBank.Invoice.Qrcode("5715709195714560");

System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes("qrcode.png", png);
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Get an invoice PDF

After its creation, an invoice PDF may be retrieved by its id.

```c#
using System;

byte[] pdf = StarkBank.Invoice.Pdf("5715709195714560");

System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes("invoice.pdf", pdf);
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Cancel an invoice

You can also cancel an invoice by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been paid already.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Invoice invoice = StarkBank.Invoice.Update(
    "6312789471657984",
    status: "canceled"
);

Console.WriteLine(invoice);
```

### Update an invoice

You can update an invoice's amount, due date and expiration by its id.

    "6312789471657984",
    amount: 99999
);

Console.WriteLine(invoice);
```

### Query invoices

You can get a list of created invoices given some filters.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Invoice> invoices = StarkBank.Invoice.Query(
    after: new DateTime(2019, 4, 1),
    before: new DateTime(2021, 4, 30)
);

foreach(StarkBank.Invoice invoice in invoices) {
    Console.WriteLine(invoice);
}
```

### Query invoice logs

Logs are pretty important to understand the life cycle of an invoice.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Invoice.Log> logs = StarkBank.Invoice.Log.Query(
    after: new DateTime(2019, 4, 1),

            tags: new List<string> { "pix", "qrcode" }
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BrcodePayment payment in payments) {
    Console.WriteLine(payment);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using BrcodePayment objects, you can also pass each payment element in dictionary format

```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Cancel a BR Code payment

You can cancel a BR Code payment by changing its status to "canceled".
Note that this is not possible if it has been processed already.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.BrcodePayment payment = StarkBank.BrcodePayment.Update(
    "6312789471657984",
    status: "canceled"
);

Console.WriteLine(payment);
```

    tags: new List<string> { "company_1", "company_2" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BrcodePayment payment in payments) {
    Console.WriteLine(payment);
}
```

### Query BR Code payment logs

Searches are also possible with BR Code payment logs:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.BrcodePayment.Log> logs = StarkBank.BrcodePayment.Log.Query(
    paymentIds: new List<string> { "5155165527080960", "76551659167801921" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BrcodePayment.Log log in logs) {
    Console.WriteLine(log);
}
```


### Get a BR Code payment log

You can also get a BR Code payment log by specifying its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.BrcodePayment.Log log = StarkBank.BrcodePayment.Log.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(log);
```

### Preview a BR Code payment

You can confirm the information on the BR Code payment before creating it with this preview method:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.BrcodePreview> previews = StarkBank.BrcodePreview.Query(
    tags: new List<string> { "00020126580014br.gov.bcb.pix0136a629532e-7693-4846-852d-1bbff817b5a8520400005303986540510.005802BR5908T'Challa6009Sao Paulo62090505123456304B14A" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BrcodePreview preview in previews) {
    Console.WriteLine(preview);
}
```

### Investigate a boleto

You can discover if a StarkBank boleto has been recently paid before we receive the response on the next day.
This can be done by creating a BoletoHolmes object, which fetches the updated status of the corresponding
Boleto object according to CIP to check, for example, whether it is still payable or not. The investigation
happens asynchronously and the most common way to retrieve the results is to register a "boleto-holmes" webhook
subscription, although polling is also possible.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.BoletoHolmes> payments = StarkBank.BoletoHolmes.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.BoletoHolmes> {
        new StarkBank.BoletoHolmes(
            boletoID: "5656565656565656",
        ),
        new StarkBank.BoletoHolmes(
            boletoID: "4848484848484848",
            tags: new List<string> { "elementary" }
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BoletoHolmes sherlock in holmes) {
    Console.WriteLine(sherlock);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using BoletoHolmes objects, you can also pass each payment element in dictionary format

### Get boleto holmes

To get a single Holmes by its id, run:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.BoletoHolmes sherlock = StarkBank.BoletoHolmes.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(sherlock);
```

### Query boleto holmes

You can search for boleto Holmes using filters.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.BoletoHolmes> holmes = StarkBank.BoletoHolmes.Query(
    tags: new List<string> { "elementary" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BoletoHolmes sherlock in holmes) {
    Console.WriteLine(sherlock);
}
```

### Query boleto holmes logs

Searches are also possible with boleto holmes logs:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.BoletoHolmes.Log> logs = StarkBank.BoletoHolmes.Log.Query(
    holmesIds: new List<string> { "5155165527080960", "76551659167801921" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.BoletoHolmes.Log log in logs) {
    Console.WriteLine(log);
}
```

### Get boleto holmes log

You can also get a boleto holmes log by specifying its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.BoletoHolmes.Log log = StarkBank.BoletoHolmes.Log.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(log);
```

### Create utility payment

It"s also simple to pay utility bills (such as electricity and water bills) in the SDK.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.UtilityPayment> payments = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.UtilityPayment> {
        new StarkBank.UtilityPayment(
            line: "83680000001 7 08660138003 0 71070987611 8 00041351685 7",
            scheduled: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(2),
            description: "take my money",
            tags: new List<string> { "take", "my", "money" }
        ),
        new StarkBank.UtilityPayment(
            barCode: "83600000001512801380037107172881100021296561",
            scheduled: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(1),
            description: "take my money one more time",
            tags: new List<string> { "again" }
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.UtilityPayment payment in payments) {
    Console.WriteLine(payment);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using UtilityPayment objects, you can also pass each payment element in dictionary format

### Query utility payments

To search for utility payments using filters, run:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.UtilityPayment> payments = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Query(
    tags: new List<string> { "electricity", "gas" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.UtilityPayment payment in payments) {
    Console.WriteLine(payment);
}
```

### Get utility payment

You can get a specific bill by its id:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.UtilityPayment payment = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(payment);
```

### Get utility payment PDF

After its creation, a utility payment PDF may also be retrieved by passing its id.

```c#
byte[] pdf = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Pdf("5155165527080960");

System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes("electricity_payment.pdf", pdf);
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Delete utility payment

You can also cancel a utility payment by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been processed already.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.UtilityPayment payment = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Delete("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(payment);
```

### Query utility bill payment logs

You can search for payments by specifying filters. Use this to understand the
bills life cycles.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log> logs = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log.Query(
    paymentIds: new List<string> { "102893710982379182", "92837912873981273" }
);

foreach(StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log log in logs) {
    Console.WriteLine(log);
}
```

### Get utility bill payment log

If you want to get a specific payment log by its id, just run:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log log = StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log.Get("1902837198237992");

Console.WriteLine(log);
```

### Create transactions

To send money between Stark Bank accounts, you can create transactions:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.Transaction> transactions = StarkBank.Transaction.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.Transaction> {
        new StarkBank.Transaction(
            amount: 100,  // (R$ 1.00)
            receiverID: "1029378109327810",
            description: "Transaction to dear provider",
            externalID: "12345",  // so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
            tags: new List<string> { "provider" }
        ),
        new StarkBank.Transaction(
            amount: 234,  // (R$ 2.34)
            receiverID: "2093029347820947",
            description: "Transaction to the other provider",
            externalID: "12346",  // so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
            tags: new List<string> { "provider" }
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.Transaction transaction in transactions) {
    Console.WriteLine(transaction);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using Transaction objects, you can also pass each transaction element in dictionary format

### Query transactions

To understand your balance changes (bank statement), you can query
transactions. Note that our system creates transactions for you when
you receive boleto payments, pay a bill or make transfers, for example.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Transaction> transactions = StarkBank.Transaction.Query(
    after: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-10),
    before: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-1)
);

foreach(StarkBank.Transaction transaction in transactions) {
    Console.WriteLine(transaction);
}
```

### Get transaction

You can get a specific transaction by its id:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Transaction transaction = StarkBank.Transaction.Get("5155165527080960");

Console.WriteLine(transaction);
```

### Create payment requests to be approved by authorized people in a cost center

You can also request payments that must pass through a specific cost center approval flow to be executed.
In certain structures, this allows double checks for cash-outs and also gives time to load your account
with the required amount before the payments take place.
The approvals can be granted at our web banking and must be performed according to the rules
specified in the cost center.

**Note**: The value of the centerID parameter can be consulted by logging into our web banking and going
to the desired Cost Center page.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<StarkBank.PaymentRequest> requests = StarkBank.PaymentRequest.Create(
    new List<StarkBank.PaymentRequest> {
        new StarkBank.PaymentRequest(
            centerID: "5656565656565656",
            due: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(2),
            payment: new StarkBank.Transfer(
                amount: 100,  // R$ 1,00
                bankCode: "033",
                branchCode: "0001",
                accountNumber: "10000-0",
                taxID: "012.345.678-90",
                name: "Master Yoda"
            )
        ),
        new StarkBank.PaymentRequest(
            centerID: "5656565656565656",
            payment: new StarkBank.BoletoPayment(
                line: "34191.09008 64694.017308 71444.640008 1 96610000014500",
                taxID: "012.345.678-90",
                description: "Payment for spare droid parts"
            ),
            tags: new List<string> { "rd2d", "invoice/1234" }
        )
    }
);

foreach(StarkBank.PaymentRequest request in requests) {
    Console.WriteLine(request);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using PaymentRequest objects, you can also pass each payment element in dictionary format

### Query payment requests

To search for payment requests, run:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.PaymentRequest> requests = StarkBank.PaymentRequest.Query(
    centerID: "5656565656565656",
    after: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-10),
    before: DateTime.Today.Date.AddDays(-1)
);

foreach(StarkBank.PaymentRequest request in requests) {
    Console.WriteLine(request);
}
```

### Create webhook subscription

To create a webhook subscription and be notified whenever an event occurs, run:

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Webhook webhook = StarkBank.Webhook.Create(
    url: "https://webhook.site/dd784f26-1d6a-4ca6-81cb-fda0267761ec",
    subscriptions: new List<string> { "transfer", "boleto", "boleto-payment", "utility-payment" }
);

Console.WriteLine(webhook);
```

### Query webhooks

To search for registered webhooks, run:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Webhook> webhooks = StarkBank.Webhook.Query();

foreach(StarkBank.Webhook webhook in webhooks) {
    Console.WriteLine(webhook);
}
```

### Get webhook

You can get a specific webhook by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Webhook webhook = StarkBank.Webhook.Get("10827361982368179");

Console.WriteLine(webhook);
```

### Delete webhook

You can also delete a specific webhook by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Webhook webhook = StarkBank.Webhook.Delete("10827361982368179");

Console.WriteLine(webhook);
```

### Process webhook events

It"s easy to process events that arrived in your webhook. Remember to pass the
signature header so the SDK can make sure it's really StarkBank that sent you
the event.

```c#
using System;

Response response = listen();  // this is the method you made to get the events posted to your webhook

StarkBank.Event parsedEvent = StarkBank.Event.Parse(
    content: response.Content,
    signature: response.Headers["Digital-Signature"]
);

if (parsedEvent.Subscription == "transfer") {
    StarkBank.Transfer.Log log = parsedEvent.Log as StarkBank.Transfer.Log;
    Console.WriteLine(log.Transfer);
}
else if (parsedEvent.Subscription == "boleto") {
    StarkBank.Boleto.Log log = parsedEvent.Log as StarkBank.Boleto.Log;
    Console.WriteLine(log.Boleto);
}
else if (parsedEvent.Subscription == "boleto-payment") {
    StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Log log = parsedEvent.Log as StarkBank.BoletoPayment.Log;
    Console.WriteLine(log.Payment);
}
else if (parsedEvent.Subscription == "utility-payment") {
    StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log log = parsedEvent.Log as StarkBank.UtilityPayment.Log;
    Console.WriteLine(log.Payment);
}
```

### Query webhook events

To search for webhook events, run:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IEnumerable<StarkBank.Event> events = StarkBank.Event.Query(
    after: DateTime.Today,
    isDelivered: false
);

foreach(StarkBank.Event eventObject in events) {
    Console.WriteLine(eventObject);
}
```

### Get webhook event

You can get a specific webhook event by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Event eventObject = StarkBank.Event.Get("10827361982368179");

Console.WriteLine(eventObject);
```

### Delete webhook event

You can also delete a specific webhook event by its id.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Event eventObject = StarkBank.Event.Delete("10827361982368179");

Console.WriteLine(eventObject);
```

### Set webhook events as delivered

This can be used in case you"ve lost events.
With this function, you can manually set events retrieved from the API as
"delivered" to help future event queries with `isDelivered: false`.

```c#
using System;

StarkBank.Event eventObject = StarkBank.Event.Update("129837198237192", isDelivered: true);

Console.WriteLine(eventObject);
```

## Handling errors

The SDK may raise one of four types of errors: __InputErrors__, __InternalServerError__, __UnknownError__, __InvalidSignatureError__

__InputErrors__ will be raised whenever the API detects an error in your request (status code 400).
If you catch such an error, you can get its elements to verify each of the
individual errors that were detected in your request by the API.
For example:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using StarkBank.Error;

try {
    List<StarkBank.Transaction> transactions = StarkBank.Transaction.Create(
        new List<StarkBank.Transaction> {
            new StarkBank.Transaction(
                amount: 99999999999999,  // (R$ 999,999,999,999.99)
                receiverID: "1029378109327810",
                description: ".",
                externalID: "12345",  // so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
                tags: new List<string> { "provider" }
            )
        }
    );
} catch (InputErrors e) {
    foreach (ErrorElement error in e.Errors) {
        Console.WriteLine(error.Code);
        Console.WriteLine(error.Message);
    }
}
```

__InternalServerError__ will be raised if the API runs into an internal error.
If you ever stumble upon this one, rest assured that the development team
is already rushing in to fix the mistake and get you back up to speed.

__UnknownError__ will be raised if a request encounters an error that is
neither __InputErrors__ nor an __InternalServerError__, such as connectivity problems.

__InvalidSignatureError__ will be raised specifically by StarkBank.Event.parse()
when the provided content and signature do not check out with the Stark Bank public
key.
